Farms Appear in Cities: When you hear the "farm", you may imagine the countryside with cows and crops. But scientists say the farms of the future could be build in tall buildings in some large cities. It may be difficult to believe, but in fact, the technology for growing crops indoors already exists. Farming in the city is already happening. Some vegetables are already grown in greenhouses. Even the scientists at the South Pole research station can enjoy fresh vegetables the grow in their own greenhouse. Expert say indoor farming solves many problems. First, traditional farming takes up a  lot of land. Growing crops in tall buildings--called verical farming(垂直农业)--can solve the problem. Also, fruits and vegetables grown indoors would not face serious threats from insects and bad weather. Though vertical farms don't exist yet, experts have created a plan for recycling in such farms. The water from indoor fish ponds would be used to water crops. Gases from crop waste would be used to heat the building. Waste from chicken or pigs would be reused as a source of energy. But experts believe vertical farming is not going to be easy. They say it can be difficault to control  climate conditions indoors. Besides, plants differ in their weather and lighting needs. For example, some plants like warm, sunny weather, but  other plants prefer cooler temperatures. That's not to say these difficulties won't be overcome--but it will take time. Most experts suggest it may take about 5 to 15 years before the first vertical farms could be created.

A Good Lesson: After living in Europe for seven years, my parents decided that my family would move to the United States. We all looked forward to this. What would people think of us?  For me, I hoped to be the hero of the class. I was not diaspointed. All my classmates admired my experience, and I quickly became well known as "the French guy". I was very popular for a  time. However, I was not interested in many things my classmates did, and it was hard for me to connect with them. I enjoyed listening to classical music, never watched TV, and almost never watched movies. I did not have a common background with my friends because I grew up in Europe. I had few friends, and fewer good friends. When I look back now, I realize I was a bit of an idiot to many people around me. I kept talking proudly  about my experience. And I thought myselft better than those around me because I lived in Europe but they didn't. I had decided I wanted better friends when my parents said that we were going to move again! I saw this as a perfect chance to get better friends, where pople did not know of my unkind past. When we moved to California, I did not show off as I had done for five years. I did not tell everyone that I lived in Europe. I still listened to classical music, but I just kept my music to myself. Sure enough, I found that people like someone who is not typical but does not boast about it . Nothing can replace good friends, and if I had to control my temper and pride,  it was well worth it.

King of Strangers: At the store where I worked, I noticed a young boy of about ten shopping alone with his school list. He placed everything in his basket and went to the checkout. The young shop assistant told him the total price, $37.60. The boy was instantly disappointed and said he had only been given $20. He took out one thing at a time until he got down to his $20.  With eyes full of tears, he asked if he could phone his mum to pick him up. When he go though, it appeared that even this was inconvenient for his mother. He bit hard on his lip to stop the tears and walked outside to wait on the bench in front of the shop. This was all too much for the young assistant who had served him and she said, "I wish I would afford to pay for the rest of his things." One of the other girls said she had a few dollars. Then two others said they could help as well. These four young girl pooled their money and found that they had more than enough money for the boy's extra purchases. So they upgraded his pens and pencils to top-quality ones, then took the bag out to the boy on the seat. His young face changed from sadness to the most beautiful smile. His mother arrived much later to pick him up. Instead of running to the car, he ran back into the store and called out, "Thank you!" I was so proud of my team that day. They did something wonderful for that boy and also found the pleasure of giving was as great as receiving.

1. When we think of muscles, we might often picture a bodybuilder with big arm and leg muscels. But our muscles do not have to look like that to work well. As a matter of fact, every time we write our name, we use the 20 different muscles in ourhand. Every time our heart beats, we use the our cardiac muscles. When eat our food, we use our tongue muscles. we even use muscle when we open and close our eye. In fact, every time we move, we use some of the muscles in our body. 3. A muscle is made of tiny fibers are packed together to make a single muscle. We all have the same number of muscles---about 700 or so. Men and women with big muscles simply have thicker bundles of fibers. 4. There are three different types of muscles in our body. Smooth muscles are the ones that we cannot control. They work quietly to keep our body running. Also, they are the oneself that help us to absorb our food. The cardiac muscle makes the heart pump blood in and out.

But if we want save our energy, try smiling instead of frowning. Remember that it Takeshi 17 muscles in our face to smile, but 43 muscles to frown!

Biological Clock: When the sun rises on a warm and sunny day, you can see some flowers open up. When they close late in the afternoon, others flowers open. Biological rhythms, like the opening and closing of flowers, happen all over nature. But not all of them are daily rhythms. Some, like the beating of our heart, happen every second. __F: Other rhythms are based on months, seasons or years.__ Scientists use the term biological clock to describe the timing that controls biological rhythms. __A: But where can you find it?__ In some animals it is probably controlled by the brain. In plants and other living things that have no brain, it must be something else. The migration of animals happens when a signal is sent out. For example, when days become shorter, birds leave the northern parts of the world and fly south where it is warm. __C: In the summer they fly back to have babies.__ Humans also have biological clocks that control their daily rhythms. When people travel by plane from one continent to another, they often cross many time zones. Their internal clocks don't seem to work correctly. We call this jet lag(时差). __B: This makes them feel tired.__ People who work night shifts also have problems with their biological clocks.
